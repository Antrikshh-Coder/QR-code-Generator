QR Code Generator

A QR code generator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript allows users to quickly create QR codes by entering text or URLs. The front-end design, using HTML and CSS, provides an intuitive user interface, while JavaScript dynamically generates the QR code based on user input. This simple and effective tool can be used for a variety of purposes, such as creating links to websites, contact details, or any other information that can be encoded into a QR code. The solution is responsive and can be easily embedded in web applications.
